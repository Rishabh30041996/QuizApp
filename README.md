# QuizApp

I divided this Quiz App in two section
1: Login and front-end part and 
2: Quiz and result.

Firstly in front-end part, I try to give intro of the website and place three quiz at the bottom of the page.
User can directly access these quiz by clicking on them or user can first login or make account and then access these quiz test.

When user click on quiz, first it will tell little about the test and then when user proceed, he/she can start the test and I set  30 sec  per question as time limit.
